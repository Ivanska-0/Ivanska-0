Here I'll upload my personal projects so anyone can see them if they're interested.
As a disclaimer, (almost) every one of them is purely PERSONAL and surely neither too optimized
(constructive criticism is welcome, though), neither too organized (I wouldn't work like this
in a team, lmao).

However, if you think you can find something useful here or are an acquaintance of mine and
curious about one proyect I have probably bragged you about; either way, you are welcome here.

And, of course, all code written in my public repositories (as you can see in the
copyright licenses) it's all open source. Because that's how it should be.

So feel free to study, copy or modify code from my projects, with or without credit.
